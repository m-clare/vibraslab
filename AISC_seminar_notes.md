Traditional stiffness criteria - L/360 or S/D < 24 do not work for vibrations (steel-framed floor systems)

Key parameters for analytics:
- calculation of first natural frequency
- calculation of maximum ampliture of acceleration or velocity due to a reference excitation
- estimate of damping

-> response is compared to tolerance limit for human comfort or sensitive equipment as applicable

Damping ratios for structural systems in Design Guide are usually between 1-8% of critical viscous damping

Fundamental modal mass (effective mass) - mass of SDOF system whose steady-state response to sinusoidal forcing = the response of structural system being considered

Evaluation criterion for Design Guide:
- prediction of structural response (acceleration or velocity)
- tolerance limit

Sensitive Equipment:
- usually velocity (sometimes acceleration or displacement)
- requirements are strict
- massive stiff floors are required

Waveform Acceleration Limit (should usually call manufacturer):

- peak to peak example:
	waveform acceleration limit

- narrowband spectrum limit:
	- RMS acceleration 

Generic limits (specific limits usually not available):
	- usualy 1/3 octave spectral velocity magnitudes
	- fourier transform and mathematical conversion

Calculate beam and girder frequency (Ch 3 - Eqn 3-2)

Mode shape can come from FEA (normalized at midspan loading and observance)

Ch. 6 is not as well established as 4-5

FEA should only be used for odd buildings (non-standard)

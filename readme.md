# About
This repository estimates the vibration characteristics (fundamental frequency) of concrete structural floors based on current Concrete Reinforcing Steel Institute (CRSI) Guidelines. Currently, it is only developed for then evaluating whether the floor passes sensitive persons/equipment criteria (i.e. for hospitals), rather than more general cases.

# Background
For an understanding of the structural systems being evaluated, I recommend perusing the background info "Concrete Rules of Thumb", p. 10-13 for an explanation of what is meant by two way slabs and slabs with drop panels.
